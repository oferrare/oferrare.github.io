<h2>The True Crime: Behind America's Deadly Fascination</h2>
<p class="description">True crime media has skyrocketed in popularity, and social media platforms have used that phenomenon to spread misinformation and almost dehumanize criminal cases. In <a href="https://soundcloud.com/olivia-ferrare/the-true-crime-behind-americas-deadly-fascinationengl-3844-podcast/s-FmRT1v30dhB?si=dce2ef7707264c19b408790033e99b0a" target="_blank">our podcast</a>, we discuss how the Gabby Petito case is a perfect example of how Instagram/Tiktok/etc. have created an unhealthy obsession with crime, sometimes against the victims' families' wishes.</p>

          <h2>My Work at the Collegiate Times</h2>
          <p class="description">
          Writing for the Collegiate Times (Virginia Tech's student newspaper) sparked my interest in journalism and my decision to minor in Professional and Technical Writing. As an editor, I find myself <a href="http://www.collegiatetimes.com/search/?l=25&s=start_time&sd=desc&f=html&t=article%2Cvideo%2Cyoutube%2Ccollection&app=editorial&nsa=eedition&q=Olivia+Ferrare" target="_blank">writing articles</a> less frequently, but I still love editing pieces and leading a team of 20 writers in creating content for campus and the surrounding community!</p>
