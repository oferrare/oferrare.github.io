          <h2>Learning to Braid: How to Start from Nothing to French Braid</h2>
          <p class="description">
            I love braiding my own and my friends' hair, and my guy friends always want to get in on the action to impress their sisters and girlfriends. My tutorial combines clips of me doing the <a href="https://youtu.be/e2Dl2CfZB0U" target="_blank">French braid process</a> of myself and my friend and I doing it together on his girlfriend. It definitely takes lots of practice and patience, but the end result looks fantastic!</p>

          <h2>My Work at the Collegiate Times</h2>
          <p class="description">
          Writing for the Collegiate Times (Virginia Tech's student newspaper) sparked my interest in journalism and my decision to minor in Professional and Technical Writing. As an editor, I find myself <a href="http://www.collegiatetimes.com/search/?l=25&s=start_time&sd=desc&f=html&t=article%2Cvideo%2Cyoutube%2Ccollection&app=editorial&nsa=eedition&q=Olivia+Ferrare" target="_blank">writing articles</a> less frequently, but I still love editing pieces and leading a team of 20 writers in creating content for campus and the surrounding community!</p>
